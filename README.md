# Conway's Game Of Life using React

The Game of Life (sometimes known as Life) is an example of a cellular automaton and zero-player game. It takes place on a two-dimensional grid in which cells can be 'alive' or 'dead'. The status of said cells is defined by a set of rules that takes into consideration the status of the cells neighbors. Patterns evolve over time across the grid with no real user input.

This project uses ReactJS and CSS. The board is rendered with a single <div> while the grid utilizes CSS linear-gradient.
The cells are a seperate component that accept x and y as inputs in order to specify its position.
